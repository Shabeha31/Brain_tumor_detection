## Project Overview
This project explores the application of deep learning models for detecting brain tumors from MRI images. The study leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and various pre-trained transfer learning models such as VGG-16, InceptionV3, and MobileNet. The models are trained and tested on MRI images with data augmentation techniques to improve generalization, mitigate overfitting, and enhance detection accuracy. Among the evaluated models, MobileNet achieved the highest accuracy, demonstrating its suitability for clinical applications..

Key objectives:
- Apply deep learning techniques for image classification.
- Compare performance of CNN and transfer learning models.
- Use data augmentation to improve model accuracy and generalization.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled MRI images divided into two categories:
- **Yes**: MRI scans showing brain tumors.
- **No**: MRI scans of healthy brains.

Data preprocessing steps include resizing, normalization, and augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming) to enhance model performance.

## Models Evaluated
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A custom architecture designed specifically for this dataset.
- **VGG-16**: A deep pre-trained network fine-tuned for tumor detection.
- **InceptionV3**: Pre-trained InceptionV3 model adapted to this classification task.
- **MobileNet**: Lightweight pre-trained MobileNet model fine-tuned for high accuracy and speed.
